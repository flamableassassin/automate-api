# Automate Flow Api
## This is for a automate flow [Click Here](https://llamalab.com/automate/community/flows/29094)
**Features:**
1. Logs (available on {ip}:3000)
2. Sends stright to your windows 10 notifications!

**Required node modules:**
1. [Local-ipv4-address](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-ipv4-address)`npm install --save local-ipv4-address
2. [Node-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier)-`npm install --save node-notifier -g`
3. [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)-`npm install express`

To start the server go to the folder in cmd [click here how to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjaCgavMO18) then put `node server.js` this should start up the server it should then get a notification with `IP:` copy the number into the flow.
(I will make a youtube view on how to do this)


if you need any help feel free to ask on my discord server: https://discord.gg/dWrQ9sw

**Update ideas:**
1. Include battery notification e.g 'your phone is on 25%' and 'your phone is fully charged!`
2. Settings for what notification you want (can be changed in website?)
